# AVR ATmega328p 

## Projects written in C++, using AVR Libs on Eclipse.

Projects I wrote with the goal of exploring the very popular ATmega328p peripherals, programming it in C++ along with the AVR libraries, instead of the Arduino IDE and framework. Projects was written in Eclipse IDE, using the AVR Plugin.
