# AVR ATmega328p 

## Projects written in C++, using AVR Libs on Eclipse and Arduino hardware.

At the time it was written I was doing a lot of things with PIC microcontrollers and decided to explore AVR mcu's due to the
price of Arduino boards and ease to find their hardware. None of the projects was written using the Arduino Libs, but C++ along with AVR Libs. In order to edit the project on Eclipse it's necessary to install the AVR Plugin for Eclipse.
